        <p class="intro">
            You knock on the door to your right, and a friendly guy answers. His charming smile and kind gesture immediately catches your eye. He invites you into his dorm, where you meet his two other roommates and two other girls who are already hanging out.

            The evening was filled with laughter and lively conversation. Max, the friendly guy who invited you in, is incredibly sweet and thoughtful. As you two continue chatting, his sweet and thoughtfulness becomes more apparent. Before the night winds down, you exchange numbers.

            It's getting late, and with the fair tomorrow morning, you need to head back to your dorm for some rest. You say your goodbyes.

                This exhibition reimagines <span class="clickable">"love"</span> by exploring the fluidity of these emotions in the digital space. From who it's with, how it looks, where it happens, etc. Through net art, we can expand our traditional boundaries and understanding of love.

                <br>
                The three works featured—<i>Queers in Love at the End of the World</i> (2013) by Anna Anthropy, <i>My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</i> (1996) by Olia Lialina and <i>skinonskinonskin</i> (1999) by Entropy8Zuper—illustrate the evolution of digital intimacy over time. Each piece uses the interactive nature of the internet to explore love’s layered dimensions: Queers in Love emphasizes the fleeting urgency of love in the face of mortality, My Boyfriend Came Back from the War examines fragmented relationships and post-trauma disconnection, while skinonskinonskin explores sensuality and emotional vulnerability within cyberspace. All of which touch on the idea of love, but in different ways. All these pieces together showcase the complexity and multifaceted nature of love. Together, these works speak to larger artistic trends in early net art, where artists used the interactive and nonlinear capacities of the internet to depict human connection in ways unachievable through traditional media. Positioned within the growing dialogue of digital identity and intimacy, this exhibition underscores how net art serves as a powerful medium to reimagine and expand our understanding of love across time and digital landscapes.

                            Queers in Love at the End of the World (2013) by Anna Anthropy depicts the passion and intensity behind love coupled with a ticking timer. An interactive hypertext game that forces players to rush through the last seconds and are forced to make quick decisions, it underscores the last impact of love even in fleeting moments. Since the characters are queer, this piece challenges how love looks and who can love each other.

                        An interactive narrative that explores the idea of love, memory and disconnection in an online environment. The couple in the game reunites after a long separation, although distance and the lack of communication had transpired the feelings of love never fade. Although the couple in the narrative was separated for so long, love was what allowed them to push through to see the next day and each day apart intensifies the longing and connection felt during their reunion. If anything, distance makes the heart grow fonder.

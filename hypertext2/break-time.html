        <h1>Taking a Break</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            The material feels overwhelming, so you decide to take a 30-minute break. As you're relaxing, your phone starts ringing-it's your mom.

        <p class="intro">
            You share with your mom how overwhelmed you feel and you're feelings of stress. She listens patiently and offers words of encouragement. You are more capable and stronger than you think. Continue studying and working hard and you will do well! Her supportive words eases your stress and you feel less alone in tackling your studies.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Feeling reassured, you spend another 30 minute reviewing the material before winding down and calling it a night.
